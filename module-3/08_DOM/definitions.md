> #### Info::Document Object Model
>
> The Document Object Model (DOM) is the programming interface for the graphical representation of documents that are loaded into the browser. It provides a way to access and manipulate the structure, style, and content once loaded.

- It's not the page source
    - The best representation is the markup that shows up in the Developer Tools of Browsers

> #### Info::DOM Manipulation
>
> DOM Manipulation is the term used to describe writing code to change and select information on the DOM using JavaScript while the page is loaded in the browser.

We will use Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

> #### Info::Vanilla JavaScript
>
> JavaScript that does not rely on any outside utility libraries to do things that can be done with functions and object defined in the ECMAScript specification.
